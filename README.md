I was successfully able to create and simulate a multistage amplifer using MULTISIM. In this case it is a two-stage (CE-CC) BJT amplifier. All requirements were met which included:
- Power supply: +𝟏𝟎𝑽 relative to the ground;
- Quiescent current drawn from the power supply: no larger than 𝟏𝟎 𝒎𝑨;
- No-load voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): |𝑨𝒗𝒐| = 𝟓𝟎 (± 𝟏𝟎%);
- Maximum no-load output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): no smaller than 8 V peak to peak;
- Loaded voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and with 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): no smaller than 𝟗𝟎% of the no-load voltage gain;
- Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): no smaller than 4 V peak to peak;
- Input resistance (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): no smaller than 𝟐𝟎 𝒌𝜴;
- Amplifier type: inverting or non-inverting;
- Frequency response: 20 Hz to 50 kHz (−𝟑𝒅𝑩 response);
- Type of transistors: BJT;
- Number of transistors (stages): no more than 3;
- Resistances permitted: values smaller than 𝟐𝟐𝟎 𝒌𝜴 from the E24 series;
- Capacitors permitted: 𝟎. 𝟏 𝝁𝑭, 𝟏. 𝟎 𝝁𝑭, 𝟐. 𝟐 𝝁𝑭, 𝟒. 𝟕 𝝁𝑭, 𝟏𝟎 𝝁𝑭, 𝟒𝟕 𝝁𝑭, 𝟏𝟎𝟎 𝝁𝑭, 𝟐𝟐𝟎 𝝁𝑭;
- Other components (BJTs, diodes, Zener diodes, etc.): only from your ELE404 lab kit

Below is an image of the final schematic of the amplifer created:
